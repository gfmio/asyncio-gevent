    """
    Wrap a future (or coroutine object) in a greenlet.

    The greenlet returned by this function will not start automatically, so you
    need to call `Greenlet.start()` manually.

    If `future` is a coroutine object, it will be scheduled as a task on the
    `loop` when the greenlet starts. If no `loop` argument has been passed, the
    running event loop will be used. If there is no running event loop, a new
    event loop will be started using the current event loop policy.

    If the future is not already scheduled, then it won't be scheduled for
    execution until the greenlet starts running. To prevent the future from
    being scheduled automatically, you can pass `autostart_future=False` as an
    argument to `future_to_greenlet`.

    If the greenlet gets killed, the by default the future gets cancelled. To
    prevent this from happening and having the future return the
    `GreenletExit` objct instead, you can pass `autocancel_future=False` as an
    argument to `future_to_greenlet`.

    If the future gets cancelled, the greenlet gets killed and will return a
    `GreenletExit`. This default behaviour can be circumvented by passing
    `autokill_greenlet=False` and the greenlet will raise the `CancelledError`
    instead.
